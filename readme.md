# Maths Panel

> A simple GUI to generate maths worksheets

# Motivation

Annoyed at the lack of native apps for generating maths worksheets, and not very happy at the excess momnetization and often-paywalled online versions, I decided to create [mathsgen](https://github.com/cooljim/mathsgen), a console-based application which can generate maths worksheets. However, it was janky, weird to work with and most importantly did not have a graphical user interface, which many initial beta testers of mathsgen wanted. So, I decided to look into options to move my existing backend logic and somehow slap that _nice_ GUI on it.

I decided to use Electron as the frontend engine, and after some tinkering I found out the basics and moved most of the backend logic from mathsgen to this application. Mathsgen will still recieve periodic patch updates, however all new features will be added here. Mathsgen is officially deprecated, and (when I get round to it) I will put up deprecation warnings on it's repo.
